- Obvious Code > Clever Code
- Maximize Locality: Keep related code together. Define things near usage. Minimize variable scope.
- Centralize Control Flow: Branching logic belongs in parents. leaf functions should be pure logic.
- Guard Clauses: Handle checks first, return early, minimize nesting.
- Functions: Do one coherent thing (ideally <70 lines). Prefer lambdas/inline logic over tiny single-use functions.
- Decompose Conditionals: Use named variables to simplify complex `if` conditions.
- Naming & Comments:
    - Comments explain *why*, not *what*; use lowercase single lines. ASCII illustrations are welcome.
- Paradigm Balance:
    - Functional: Prefer pure functions (data in, data out) and immutability for logic.
    - Procedural: Use direct loops and local mutation when simpler or significantly more performant.
