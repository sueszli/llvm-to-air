world is more compute hungry than ever
new accelerators coming out fast
yet we cant target them
MLIR gives us the tools to find the right abstractions (both low and high) for portable performance
yet it doesn't have an apple silicon gpu backend

https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-mps-dialect-in-mlir/77102

however mojo lang which uses MLIR has found a way to target MPS:
mlir -> llvm ir (xdsl lowering) -> air (the llvm_to_air.py script) -> metallib

https://forum.modular.com/t/apple-silicon-gpu-support-in-mojo/2295

this is a learning opportunity for me to try to publically replicate how i believe they have achieved this
and show an end-to-end example of how to implement a custom language / mlir-dialect and then lower it to metallib!
